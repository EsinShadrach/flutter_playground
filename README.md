## Page Animation

The `Page Animation` example demonstrates a page transition animation using the `PageRouteBuilder` and `SlideTransition`. It comprises two screens - the first screen with a button to navigate to the second screen. The animation is achieved by sliding the first screen out from the bottom. Explore the code and run the app to see the animation in action.
